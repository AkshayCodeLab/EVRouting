This is the backend repository of the project: Optimal routing of electric vehicles via Graph Algorithms using Constrained bounded shortest path approach. 

**Focus of this project:**

• To develop an intelligent routing system for Electric Vehicles to optimize travel time, energy consumption, and
charging stops and increased safety.

• Personalized routes based on vehicle model, battery levels, and energy efficiency for seamless journeys.

• Automated charging station selection and charge level optimization to prevent range anxiety and save time.

• Developed a Proof of Concept to showcase real-time route planning and efficiency.

• Tech Stack: Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot, React.js, REST APIs, SQL
